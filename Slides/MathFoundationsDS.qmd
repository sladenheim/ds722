## Mathematical Foundations of DS

Welcome to DS722, Mathematical Foundations of DS.

Data science is a multidisciplinary field that combines mathematics, computer science, and domain expertise to extract insights and knowledge from data.

This is a Master's level introduction to the mathematical foundations that a data scientist needs.

## Why Mathematics Matters in DS

Mathematics is the backbone of data science. It helps us:

:::: {.incremental}
- Formulate models and algorithms that interpret data
- Understand the theoretical limits of what data can reveal
- Ensure robustness and reproducibility of results
- Analyze error bounds and optimize performance
::::

:::: {.fragment}
Without a solid mathematical foundation, it’s easy to misuse algorithms or misinterpret insights.

## Course Overview

In DS722 we'll explore:

- Linear algebra
- Optimization
- Probability and Statistics

## Grading Breakdown

Your grade is comprised of:

- Homework (20%)
- Discussion participation (10%)
- Midterm (35%)
- Final (35%)

## Homework

- There are 8 total homework assignments.

- Your lowest homework grade is dropped.

- Students are allotted a total of 5 late homework days throughout the semester, with a maximum of 2 days
allowed per assignment. Late submissions beyond this policy will not be accepted.


## Discussions

- Each week there are discussion sections. 

- Attendance will be recorded weekly during the 12 scheduled discussion sections. Students may miss up to 3
sessions and still receive full participation credit. 

- If more than 3 discussions are missed, participation credit
will be prorated based on the percentage of sessions attended.


## Shared Computing Cluster

You have each been given an account on the BU Shared Computing Cluster (SCC). 

You may use this computational resource for both your homework assignments and discussion sections. 

I have included instructions for how to use the SCC on Piazza.

## SCC Overview

The SCC is a heterogeneous linux cluster.

The system currently includes:

- $>$12,000 CPU cores
- $>$400 GPUs
- $>$ 14 Pb of storage

---

### Helpful Resources

Helpful information for the SCC can be found:

- General support information: [RCS Overview](https://www.bu.edu/tech/support/research/)
- [Linux Cheat Sheet](https://scv.bu.edu/documents/Linux_SCC_CheatSheet.pdf)
- [SCC Cheat Sheet](https://scv.bu.edu/documents/SCC_CheatSheet.pdf)

If you encounter any issues using the SCC direct questions to the teaching staff prior to reaching out to RCS help.

### Project ds722

All of your work will can done using the `ds722` project.

Each student has a small home directory located at `/projectnb/ds722/students/`
Each student has a 10 GB quota on their home directory.

Additional storage space can be used in `/projectnb/ds722/projects/`.

The discussion notebooks will become available in `/projectnb/ds722/materials/`.

### SCC OnDemand

Use the SCC through the [OnDemand](scc-ondemand.bu.edu) interface.

### Using Python

Please review the documentation for [using Python](https://www.bu.edu/tech/support/research/software-and-programming/common-languages/python/) on the SCC.

In particular read the information about the [Academic ML Environment](https://www.bu.edu/tech/support/research/software-and-programming/common-languages/python/python-ml/academic-machine-learning-environment/).

### Using conda on the SCC

Configure where your potential conda environments are stored using the command line.

## Quick SCC Demo

Let me provide a quick SCC demo of how to use Jupyter on the SCC.

You will gain more experience doing this during the first discussion.

## Generative AI Policy

This course follows the **CDS Generative AI Assistance (GAIA) Policy**. 

Please read and understand the policy:  
[bu.edu/cds-faculty/culture-community/gaia-policy](https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/culture-community/gaia-policy)

You must disclose how you use tools like ChatGPT in your work.

### Your Responsibility

- You’re encouraged to use AI tools to explore and understand course material.
- AI should *support* your learning, not *replace* it.
- Your insights and problem-solving skills are what truly count.
  
Relying too heavily on tools without mastering concepts may affect your performance on the exams.

**Use AI as a learning aid—not a substitute for thinking.**

## Academic Integrity

Discussion with classmates is permitted,  
but copying answers or plagiarizing is strictly prohibited.

Your submitted work must be entirely your own.  
All members of the class—including teaching staff—must uphold the [Academic Code of Conduct](http://www.bu.edu/dos/policies/student-responsibilities/)

---

### Searching for Solutions Online

Before turning to the internet, ask yourself:

1. **Stuck on where to begin?**  
   Reach out to a TF or post on Piazza. You’ll often get helpful guidance quickly.

2. **Trying to validate your solution?**  
   Can you find a way to verify it independently? That’s a powerful learning opportunity.

3. **Short on time and tempted to search?**  
   Consider this:
   - It’s intellectually dishonest.  
   - You’ll need to solve similar problems on exams.  
   - You may skip one homework without penalty.

It's better to submit what you have and plan ahead for future assignments.

## Math is Fun
  
I’m excited to teach you about the world of mathematics and data.

Feel free to ask questions, share your thoughts, and challenge ideas.  
Your curiosity is the key to a great learning experience!

_You’re not just here to absorb knowledge—you’re here to apply it, explore it, and transform it._
