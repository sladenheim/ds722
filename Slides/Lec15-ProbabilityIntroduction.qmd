## Lecture Overview

Probability is the mathematical language of uncertainty.

- **Quantify Uncertainty**: Probability helps data scientists reason about randomness and uncertainty in data.
- **Statistical Inference**: Core to techniques like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and Bayesian inference.
- **Machine Learning**: Many models (e.g., Naive Bayes, HMMs) are built on probabilistic foundations.
- **Decision Making**: Supports risk assessment and informed choices under uncertainty (e.g., A/B testing).
- **Bayesian Thinking**: Enables updating beliefs with new data, useful in dynamic systems like recommendations.

## Lecture Objectives

Understand:

- sample spaces and events
- basic axioms of probability
- independent events
- conditional probability
- Bayes' Theorem
- frequentist vs Bayesian approach

## Sample Spaces and Events

The sample space $\Omega$ is the set of possible outcomes of an experiment. Points $\omega\in\Omega$ are called sample outcomes, realizations, or elements.

Subsets, i.e., $A\subseteq\Omega$ are called events.

---

What is $\Omega$ if we toss a coin twice? What is the event $A$ that the first toss is heads?

::: {.notes}
$\Omega = \{ HH, HT, TH, TT\}$ and $A=\{HH, HT\}$.
:::

---

Let $\omega$ be the outcome of a measurement of temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). What is $\Omega$? 

What is the event that a measurement is strictly larger than 15 but less than or equal to 30?

::: {.notes}
$\Omega = \mathbb{R}$ and $A=(15, 30]$.
:::

---

If we toss a coin forever, what is $\Omega$? 

What is the event that the first head appears on the second toss?

::: {.notes}
$\Omega = \{\omega = (\omega_{1},\omega_{2},\ldots, ): \omega_{i}\in \{H, T\}\}$.

$E = \{(\omega_{1},\omega_{2},\ldots, ): \omega_{1} = T, \omega_{2}=T, \omega_{3}=H,\omega_{i}\in\{H, T\}~\text{for}~i>3 \}$.

:::

## Notation

Given an event $A$, let $A^{c} = \{ \omega\in\Omega: \omega \notin A\}$ denote the complement of $A$. The complement of $A$ is the set of all elements not in $A$.

The complement of the sample space $\Omega$ is the empty set $\emptyset$.

---

The union of events $A$ and $B$ is defined as  

$$
A\cup B = \{\omega\in\Omega: \omega\in A ~\text{or}~\omega\in B \}.
$$

If $A_1, A_2,\ldots$ is a sequence of sets then

$$
\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_{i}=\{\omega\in\Omega: \omega\in A_{i} ~\text{for at least one i}\}.
$$

---

The intersection of $A$ and $B$ is
$$A\cap B = \{\omega\in\Omega: \omega\in A ~\text{and}~\omega\in B \}.
$$

If $A_1, A_2,\ldots$ is a sequence of sets then

$$
\bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty}A_{i}=\{\omega\in\Omega: \omega\in A_{i} ~\text{for all i}\}.
$$


---

The set difference is defined by

$$
A\setminus B = \{\omega\in\Omega: \omega\in A,~\omega\notin B \}.
$$

If every element of $A$ also belongs to $B$, then we write $A\subseteq B$. If $A$ is a finite set then $\vert A\vert$ denotes the number of elements in $A$.

---

A sequence of sets $A_1, A_2\ldots$ are disjoint (or mutually exclusive) if $A_i\cap A_j=\emptyset$ whenever $i\neq j$.

A partition of $\Omega$ is a sequence of disjoint sets $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ such that $\cup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_{i}=\Omega$.

A sequence of sets $A_1, A_2\ldots$ is monotone increasing if $A_1\subseteq A_2 \subseteq \ldots$ and we define $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} A_{n} = \cup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_{i}$.

A sequence of sets $A_1, A_2\ldots$ is monotone decreasing if $A_1\supseteq A_2 \supseteq \ldots$ and we define $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} A_{n} = \cap_{i=1}^{\infty}A_{i}$.

The indicator function of $A$ is defined as
$$
I_{A}(\omega) = I(\omega\in A) = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if}~\omega\in A\\
0 & \text{if}~\omega\notin A.
\end{cases}
$$

## Probability

We will assign a real number $\mathbb{P}(A)$ to every $A$. This number is the probability (or probability measure) of $A$. 

Such a function $\mathbb{P}$ is a probability measure if it satisfies the following three axioms.

1. $\mathbb{P}(A)\geq 0$ for every $A$
1. $\mathbb{P}(\Omega)=1$
1. If $A_1, A_2,\ldots$ are disjoint then 
$$
\mathbb{P}\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_{i}\right)= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\mathbb{P}(A_i).
$$

---

For any events $A$ and $B$

$$
\mathbb{P}\left(A\cup B\right) = \mathbb{P}(A) + \mathbb{P}(B) - \mathbb{P}(A\cap B).
$$

::: {.notes}
Write $A\cap B = (A\cap B^{c}) \cup (A\cap B) \cup (A^{c}\cap B)$
then
$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}\left(A\cup B\right) &= \mathbb{P}((A\cap B^{c}) \cup (A\cap B) \cup (A^{c}\cap B)) \\
&= \mathbb{P}(A\cap B^{c}) + \mathbb{P}(A\cap B) +  \mathbb{P}(A^{c}\cap B) + \mathbb{P}(A\cap B) - \mathbb{P}(A\cap B) \\
&= \mathbb{P}((A\cap B^{c})\cup (A\cap B)) + \mathbb{P}((A^{c}\cap B)\cup (A\cap B)) - \mathbb{P}(A\cup B) \\
&= \mathbb{P}(A) + \mathbb{P}(B) - \mathbb{P}(A\cap B).
\end{align}
$$
:::

## Probability on Finite Sample Spaces

If $\Omega$ is finite and if each outcome $\omega$ is equally likely, then

$$
\mathbb{P}(A) = \frac{\vert A\vert}{\vert\Omega\vert}.
$$

---

The sample space of tossing a (6-sided) die twice consists of 36 elements: $\Omega = \{(i,j):~i,j\in\{1,2,3,4,5,6\} \}$.

What is the probability that the sum of the dice is 11?

## Independent Events

Two events $A$ and $B$ are independent if 

$$
\mathbb{P}(A\cap B) = \mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(B).
$$

A set of events $\{A_{i}:~i\in I\}$ is independent if 

$$
\mathbb{P}\left(\bigcap_{i\in J}A_{i}\right) = \prod_{i\in J}\mathbb{P}(A_{i}),
$$

for every finite subset $J$ of $I$.

---

**Example** 
Toss a fair coin 10 times. Let $A$ be the event that at least one head occurs. Let $T_{j}$ be the event that tails occurs on the $j$-th toss. What is $\mathbb{P}(A)$?

::: {.notes}
$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}(A) &= 1 - \mathbb{P}(A^{c}) \\
&= 1 - \mathbb{P}(T_{1}\cap T_{2}\cap\cdots \cap T_{10}) \\
&= 1 - \mathbb{P}(T_{1})\cdots \mathbb{P}(T_{10}) \\
& = 1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{10}\approx 0.999.
\end{align}
$$
:::

---

Independence can arise by:

1. Explicit assumption
1. Derivation via the previous formula

**Disjoint events each with positive probability can never be independent.**

::: {.notes}
$\mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(B) > 0$ but $\mathbb{P}(A\cap B) = \mathbb{P}(\emptyset) = 0$.
:::

## Conditional Probability

If $\mathbb{P}(B)>0$ then the conditional probability of $A$ given $B$ is

$$
\mathbb{P}(A\vert B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A\cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}.
$$

If $A$ and $B$ are independent events then $\mathbb{P}(A\vert B) = \mathbb{P}(A)$.

In general $\mathbb{P}(A\vert B) \neq \mathbb{P}(B\vert A)$.

A medical test for a disease $D$ has outcomes $+$ and $-$. The probabilities are


|          | $D$      | $D^{c}$
|----------|----------|----------
| $+$      | 0.009    | 0.099
| $-$      | 0.001    | 0.891

Suppose you get a positive test result, what is the probability you have the disease?

---

::: {.notes}
From the definition of conditional probability

$$
\mathbb{P}(+\vert D) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(+\cap D)}{\mathbb{P}(D)} = \frac{0.009}{0.009+0.001} = 0.9
$$
and
$$
\mathbb{P}(+\vert D^{c}) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(-\cap D^{c})}{\mathbb{P}(D)} = \frac{0.891}{0.891+0.0.099} \approx 0.9
$$
The test is accurate, sick people yield a positive 90 percent of the time and healthy people yield a negative about 90 percent of the time.

The answer is
$$
\mathbb{P}(D\vert +) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(+\cap D)}{\mathbb{P}(+)} = \frac{0.009}{0.009+0.099} \approx 0.08
$$
The lesson here is that you need to compute the answer numerically. Don't trust your intution!

## Law of Total Probability

Let $A_1, \ldots, A_k$ be a partition of $\Omega$, then for any event $B$

$$
\mathbb{P}(B) = \sum_{i=1}^{k}\mathbb{P}(B\vert A_{i})\mathbb{P}(A_i).
$$

---

![Law of Total Probability](figures/LawOfTotalProbability.png){fig-align="center"}

---

*Proof*

::: {.notes}
Defince $C_{j} = B\cap A_{j}$ and note that $C_{1},\dots, C_{k}$ are disjoint and $B=\cup_{j=1}^{k}C_{j}$, hence

$$
\mathbb{P}(B) = \sum_{j=1}^{k}\mathbb{P}(C_{j}) = \sum_{j=1}^{k}\mathbb{P}(B\cap A_{j}) = \sum_{j=1}^{k}\mathbb{P}(B\vert A_{j})\mathbb{P}(A_{j}).
$$
:::

## Bayes' Theorem
Let $A_1,\ldots, A_k$ be a partition of $\Omega$ such that $\mathbb{P}(A_{i})>0$ for each $i$. If $\mathbb{P}(B)>0$ then, for each $i=1,\ldots,k$

$$
\mathbb{P}(A_{i}\vert B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(B\vert A_i)\mathbb{P}(A_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{k} \mathbb{P}(B\vert A_{j})\mathbb{P}(A_{j})}.
$$

---

If we only consider a single event $A$, then we have 
$$
\mathbb{P}(A\vert B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(B\vert A)\mathbb{P}(A)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}.
$$

:::: {.incremental}
- $P(A)$ is the **prior probability** of $A$
- $P(A|B)$ is the **posterior probability** of $A$
::::

---

*Proof*

::: {.notes}
We apply the definition of conditional probability twice, followed by the law of total probability:

$$
\mathbb{P}(A_{i}\vert B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A_{i}\cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)} = \frac{\mathbb{P}(B\vert A_{i})\mathbb{P}(A_{i})}{\mathbb{P}(B)} = \frac{\mathbb{P}(B\vert A_{i})\mathbb{P}(A_{i})}{\sum_{j=1}^{k} \mathbb{P}(B\vert A_{j})\mathbb{P}(A_{j})}
$$

## Frequentist vs Bayesian Probability

Frequentist and Bayesian thinking are two different *interpretations*  of what probability fundamentally represents.

**Frequentism**: Probability is objective and based on repeatable experiments. The probability of an event is the long-run relative frequency of repeatable random experiment.

**Bayesian:** Probability is subjective and reflects personal belief, updated by data. The probability of an event quantifies a degree of belief in a hypothesis.

The rules for computing probability remain the same in both.

---

### Philosophical Differences

- **Frequentist:** Probability is objective and based on repeatable experiments.
- **Bayesian:** Probability is subjective and reflects personal belief, updated by data.

| Aspect                | Frequentist Approach                                   | Bayesian Approach                                   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Parameters            | Fixed but unknown                                     | Treated as random variables with distributions      |
| Inference             | Based on observed data only                           | Combines prior beliefs and observed data            |
| Prior Information     | Not used                                              | Explicitly incorporated via prior distributions     |

### Example: Flipping a Coin


- **Frequentist:** The probability of a coin landing heads being 50% means if you flip a coin an infinite number of times, the proportion of heads would converge to 0.5.
- **Bayesian:** The probability of a coin landing on heads being 50% means they believe it is equally likely to land on heads as on tails. If they observe a series of flips, they update their initial belief (prior) to a new belief (posterior) using Bayes' theorem.
