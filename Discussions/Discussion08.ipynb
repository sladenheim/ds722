    "Using the `scipi.stats` library, plot the following distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Normal distribution on a single figure with \n",
    "    - mean 0 and standard deviation 1\n",
    "    - mean 5 and standard deviation 2\n",
    "    - mean -3 and standard deviation 0.5\n",
    "2. Exponential distribution on a single figure with \n",
    "    - rate parameter 1\n",
    "    - rate parameter 0.5\n",
    "    - rate parameter 2\n",
    "3. Binomial distribution on a single figure with number of trials 10 and probability of success 0.6. Feel free to add additional plots with different parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions you will need are `scipy.stats.norm`, `scipy.stats.expon`, and `scipy.stats.binom`. You can use the `pdf` method to get the probability density function for continuous distributions and the `pmf` method for discrete distributions. For the binomial distribution, you can use `plt.stem` to create a stem plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to plot the normal distribution with mean `mu` and variance `std`, you can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mu = 0\n",
    "std = 1\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "from scipy.stats import norm\n",
    "x = np.linspace(-4, 4, 1000)\n",
    "plt.plot(x, norm.pdf(x, mu, std))\n",
    "plt.title(f'Normal Distribution (mu={mu}, std={std})')\n",
    "plt.xlabel('x')\n",
    "plt.ylabel('Probability Density Function')\n",
    "plt.show()\n",

Overlay a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation as the sample means and sample standard deviations.\n",
