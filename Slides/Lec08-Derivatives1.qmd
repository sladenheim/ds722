## Lecture Overview

Calculus is the branch of mathematics  focused on the study of continuous change.

The core concepts of calculus are limits, derivatives, and integrals.

We will need these concepts in our future understanding of:

- Optimization
- Probability

## Lecture Objectives

Review:

- Concepts of limits and single variable derivatives
- Derivative rules:
  - Polynomials, trigonometric, exponential, and log functions
  - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
  - Chain rule
- Taylor's Theorem
- Partial derivatives and the gradient

## Limits

The limit of a function $f(x)$ is defined as

$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x) = L.
$$

This definition means that the function $f(x)$ approaches the limit $L$ as $x$ approaches the value $c$.

The value of $L$ need not be finite.

---

More precisely, we say that the limit of a function 
$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x) = L,
$$ 

if for any $\varepsilon>0$, there exists a $\delta>0$ such that

$$
\vert f(x) - L\vert < \varepsilon,
$$

provided $\vert x-c\vert < \delta$.

## One-Sided Limts

We can be more specific and have the left-sided limit

$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow c^-{}} f(x),
$$

and the right-sided limit

$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow c^{+}} f(x).
$$

When these values are equal we have

$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow c^-{}} f(x)= \lim_{x\rightarrow c^{+}} f(x) = \lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x) = L.
$$

## Examples

Calculate 

$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow 2} x^{2} + 3x + 4 
$$

---

Calculate

$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} \sin{(x)}
$$

---

Calculate

$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} \log{(x)}
$$

---

$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{x}
$$

---

$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin{(x)}}{x} 
$$

---

$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} \frac{\cos{(x)}-1}{x} 
$$

## Derivative Definition

The derivative $f^{\prime}(x)$ of single-variable real-valued function $f(x)$ at the point $x$ is

$$
f^{\prime}(x) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.
$$

Functions for which the derivative exists over their defined domain are called *differentiable*.

---

Another common notation for a derivative is

$$
f^{\prime}(x) = \frac{d}{dx}f(x).
$$


## Polynomial

The differentiation rules for polynomials are

$$
\frac{d}{dx}x^{n} = n x^{n-1}.
$$

---

For example, if $f(x) = x^{3}$ calculate $f^{\prime}(x)$

:::: {.fragment}
$$
f^{\prime}(x) = 3x^{2}.
$$
::::

---

If $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ what is $f^{\prime}(x)$?

:::: {.fragment}
$$
\sqrt{x} = x^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{2}x^{-\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}.
$$
::::

---

How do we calculate derivatives of more complex functions such as

$$
f(x) = 10x^{2} - 3x^{6} - x^{-\frac{3}{2}}?
$$


## Addition Rule

For differentiable functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$

$$
(f(x) + g(x))^{\prime} = f^{\prime}(x) + g^{\prime}(x) 
$$

---

In addition let $c$ be a constant, then

$$
(cf(x))^{\prime}(x) = cf^{\prime}(x).
$$

Therefore,

$$
(f(x) - g(x))^{\prime} = f^{\prime}(x) - g^{\prime}(x).
$$

---

How do we calculate derivatives of more complex polynomials such as $f(x) = 10x^{2} - 3x^{6} - x^{-\frac{3}{2}}?$

:::: {.fragment}
$$
f^{\prime}(x) = 20x - 18x^{5} + \frac{3}{2}x^{-\frac{5}{2}}.
$$

## Trigonometric Function Derivatives

The derivative rules for $\sin$ and $\cos$ are 

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dx}\sin{(x)} &= \cos{(x)} \\
\frac{d}{dx}\cos{(x)} &= -\sin{(x)} \\
\end{align}
$$

--- 

Let's prove the derivative for $\sin$. By definition we have to compute

$$
\lim_{h\rightarrow \infty} \frac{\sin{(x+h)}-\sin{(x)}}{h}.
$$


---

How could we derive these for other trigonometric functions like 

$$
\small
\begin{align}
\tan{(x)} &= \frac{\sin{(x)}}{\cos{(x)}}$, \\
\csc{(x)} &= \frac{1}{\sin{(x)}}, \\ 
\sec{(x)} &= \frac{1}{\cos{(x)}}, \\
\cot{(x)} &= \frac{1}{\tan{(x)}} ?
\end{align}
$$

We need help from the multiplication and quotient rules.


## Multiplication Rule

For differentiable functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ 

$$
(f(x)g(x))^{\prime} = f^{\prime}(x)g(x) + f(x)g^{\prime}(x).
$$

## Quotient Rule

For differentiable functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)\neq 0$ 

$$
\left(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right)^{\prime} = \frac{f^{\prime}(x)g(x) - f(x)g^{\prime}(x)}{(g(x))^{2}}.
$$

---

Let's derive $\frac{d}{dx}\tan{(x)}$:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\tan{(x)} =\frac{d}{dx} \left(\frac{\sin{(x)}}{\cos{(x)}}\right)
$$

## Exponential

The derivative of the exponential function is

$$
\frac{d}{dx}e^{x}= e^{x}.
$$

## Logarithm

The derivative of the logarithm function is

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\log{(x)}= \frac{1}{x}.
$$

## Chain Rule

For differentiable functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ 

$$
f(g(x))^{\prime} = f^{\prime}(g(x))g^{\prime}(x).
$$

## Higher-Order Derivatives

We can define second- and higher-order derivatives using our definitions. The following is a second derivative:

$$
f^{\prime\prime}(x) = \frac{d}{dx^{2}} f(x) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f^{\prime}(x+h)-f^{\prime}(x)}{h}.
$$

For higher-order derivatives we have

$$
f^{(n)}(x) = \frac{d}{dx^{n}}f(x).
$$

## Partial Derivatives

We can extend the concept of a derivative to for functions of 2 or more variables. Consider a real-valued function $f(x,y)$.

The partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$ is

$$
\small
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}f(x,y) = f_{x}(x, y) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h, y) - f(x,y)}{h}.
$$

Similarly, The partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $y$ is

$$
\small
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}f(x,y) = f_{y}(x, y) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x, y+h) - f(x,y)}{h}.
$$

---

For a real-valued function $f: \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ the $i$th partial derivative is

$$
\scriptsize
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}}f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x_{1},\dots, x_{i}+h,\ldots, x_{n}) - f(x_{1},\dots, x_{i},\ldots, x_{n})}{h}
$$

---

Higher-order partial derivatives are defined similarly. For example, the second partial derivative of $f(x,y)$ is

$$
\small
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{2}}f(x,y) = f_{xx}(x, y) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f_{x}(x+h, y) - f_{x}(x,y)}{h}.
$$

## Gradients

Given a real-valued function $f(\mathbf{x})$ with $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the gradient is a vector consisting of all partial derivatives of $f$:

$$
\nabla f(\mathbf{x}) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{1}}f(\mathbf{x}) \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{2}}f(\mathbf{x}) \\
\vdots \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{n}}f(\mathbf{x}) \\
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

## Taylor Series

The Taylor series of a real function $f(x)$ that is infinitely differentiable at a real number $c$ is the infinite *power series*

$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(c)(x-c)^{n}}{n!}.
$$


---

If we let $f(x)=e^{x}$ and $c=0$ we obtain the famous formula

$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{n}}{n!}.
$$

## Taylor's Theorem

Let $k$ be an integer and let the function $f(:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R})$ be $k$ times differentiable at the point $c\in\mathbb{R}$. Then there exists a function $h_{k}:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that

$$
\small
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{k} \frac{f^{(n)}(c)(x-c)^{n}}{n!} + h_{k}(x)(x-a)^{k},
$$
and

$$
\small
\lim_{x\rightarrow c}h_{k}(x) = 0.
$$
